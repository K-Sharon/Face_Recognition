# Face Recognition System

This project is a face recognition system developed using Python and the `face_recognition` library. The system can recognize faces in real-time using the webcam or process images from a directory. It identifies known faces by comparing them with pre-encoded face data.

## Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition via webcam.
- Encodes faces from a directory of known images.
- Matches unknown faces with the known face encodings.
- Displays the recognized person's name on the detected face.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and webcam integration.
- **face_recognition**: For face detection and recognition.
